# Regression-Analysis
This project uses regression analysis to explore the relationships between health indicators (e.g., smoking, weight, cholesterol) and outcomes like high blood pressure (HBP) and coronary heart disease (CHD). It identifies key predictors, evaluates interaction effects, and emphasizes cross-validation and visualization for interpreting health data.
